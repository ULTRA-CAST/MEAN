# ShintoCoin
## Objectives:
* Practice using Angular routing to navigate to different components
* The service may hold data that can be accessed by the components

Create your very own crypto currency website, ShintoCoins, where guests can gain new coins, buy, sell and view the transaction history of ShintoCoins. You do not have to include a database for this assignment. Instead, you may use the Service to hold data needed for multiple partials. 

Examine the following code, which shows how a Service may have an attribute, such as an array or an object. The attribute can be shared with different components. Components may also alter the Service's attributes. Remember the difference between passing by value and passing by reference? Any component with a pointer to the Service's attributes will see those changes as well.
